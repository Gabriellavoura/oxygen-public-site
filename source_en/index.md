# Welcome to OxyGEN
Oxy**GEN** is an open hardware project to build an emergency mechanism that automates an AMBU type manual respirator in extreme shortage situations such as the one caused by **coronavirus** (COVID-19) in some parts of the world.

Drawings and instructions are available free of charge. It can be built in a few hours, without prior training or specialized tools. All the parts that make up Oxy**GEN** are easy to get anywhere in the world. It just takes a little ingenuity, a wiper motor, and a few basic materials.

<p>Oxy<strong>GEN</strong> is designed to ease workload on the health personnel. <span class="danger" style="color: #fb4949;">This is not a medical device</span> and there is still a lot of work to be done in refining its design - it is a first step. Oxy<strong>GEN</strong> must always be used under medical supervision.</p>

The project was born in March 2020, in the midst of a health crisis caused by the **coronavirus** (sars-cov-2). Its purpose is to respond to the possibility of a lack of emergency respirators in health systems around the world.

# Project overview
* Use salvaged parts from cars or small appliances, so that anyone can build it.
* Offer the project free of charge and open to the entire community.
* Offer quality information so that everyone can build and manipulate it.
* Ensure proper performance in emergency situations through simplicity of design and components.
* No modification is made to the medical device. The AMBU operates in the same way as it always does, but automated.
* Modular design so that the community can modify it and contribute their ideas.

# Warnings
* A well used respirator saves lives, when poorly used it can lead to the death of the patient.
* The device must be used exclusively under the supervision of qualified healthcare personnel
* The basic design does not filter the exhaled air, which is released into the environment. Staying close to the infected patient is not recommended. We are working on this challenge for the next versions.

# Next steps
This project was born today, 03/15/2020, with the desire to grow, improve and expand. Therefore we detail a small list here with brainstorming purposes, which can be used in subsequent iterations of the Oxy**GEN**, in which we would like you to participate as well.
* Dimming the motor to adjust speed, with the low cost philosophy in mind, we have thought of a heater rheostat.
* Create a system that allows the exhaled air to be redirected through the AMBU to inactivate the virus and achieve an aseptic environment.
In the idea of lightly guiding the brainstorming process, we have researched a few ways to achieve asepsis. We came across a very recent [post](https://foro.coronavirusmakers.org/index.php?p=/discussion/24/alternativas-para-filtro-antiviral-a-la-salida-del-ambu#latest)  in [CoronaVirusMakers](https://foro.coronavirusmakers.org/) discussing the possibility of the removal of the virus with a bubble column containing and oxidant like bleach.
* Add a sensing system to warn if the breathing speed is reduced with respect to the desired one, to prevent the wear of parts or failures.
* The axis-body union must be improved.
* Find other accessible material to replace the wood.
* Make it compatible with Rees system.
